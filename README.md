Plans for improving the project. While working on the project, you might have some ideas on how to improve the webpage, such as extra styling or useful features. Try coming up with at least one improvement that you’d like to implement in the future, or learn how to implement. This doesn’t mean you’ll have to work on it, but doing so would be a real plus for your portfolio. It shows that you can think larger, express your individuality, and do more than simply follow instructions.

While working on the project, common style features have been used to create a smooth transition from header background to main content section. In the future I would like to maintain that but also explore and improve this in many other ways that can translate the same concept.
